The patient should continue to prioritize rest and maintain high fluid intake (water, broths, electrolyte solutions) to prevent dehydration. Over-the-counter medications should be used for symptomatic relief of fever, pain, and congestion. We recommend monitoring for signs of worsening illness, such as persistent high fever (over 102\u00b0F/38.9\u00b0C), difficulty breathing, chest pain, or symptoms lasting longer than 10-14 days, which might indicate a secondary bacterial infection. Avoid public settings where possible to reduce transmission."

The patient must self-isolate immediately. Aggressive management of fever and body aches using NSAIDs or acetaminophen. Recommend immediate testing for Influenza A/B and SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) to confirm diagnosis and determine appropriate antiviral use. If confirmed as Influenza and symptom onset is less than 48 hours, antiviral medication may be initiated. Monitor for warning signs of complication, such as difficulty breathing, chest pain, confusion, or inability to keep fluids down.",

Given the severity and multi-system involvement, especially the bleeding/bruising (indicating potential thrombocytopenia or coagulopathy) and fever/fatigue (suggesting bone marrow failure or infection), an immediate, urgent workup is required.",

Immediate comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), coagulation studies (PT/INR, aPTT), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Type and screen (T&S) established due to potential need for emergent blood product transfusion (e.g., platelets, packed red blood cells). Blood cultures should be drawn immediately before administering any empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics, as these patients are often severely immunocompromised (neutropenic fever). Patient should be placed on strict isolation precautions. Consultation with Hematology/Oncology is urgent for definitive diagnosis (likely bone marrow biopsy/aspiration) and initiation of induction chemotherapy or supportive care.",
